<h2 id="usage-example" style="color:#FF6347;">üí° Usage Example</h2>

To demonstrate the functionality, consider the following code example:

```swift
// Initialize members
var members = [Member(name: "Alice", age: 25, title: "Developer", zodiacSign: "Leo", contact: "alice@example.com", level: "Gold"),
               Member(name: "Bob", age: 30, title: "Designer", zodiacSign: "Aries", contact: "bob@example.com", level: "Silver")]

// Sort members by age
let sortedMembers = sortByAge(members)

// Filter members by minimum age
let adultMembers = filterByAge(members, minAge: 21)

// Calculate average age
let avgAge = averageAge(members)

print("Sorted Members: \(sortedMembers)")
print("Adult Members: \(adultMembers)")
print("Average Age: \(avgAge)")
