<h2 id="project-overview" style="color:#FF6347;">üìñ Project Overview</h2>

The **Neon Academy Member Directory** project is designed to organize and display essential data about members in the Neon Academy. It utilizes Swift protocols, structs, and classes to create a flexible and extensible structure for storing and retrieving member information.

---

<h2 id="features" style="color:#4682B4;">‚ú® Features</h2>

This project includes several key features:

- **Member Information Management**: Stores each member‚Äôs name, title, horoscope, membership level, home town, age, and contact details.
- **Information Display**: Allows displaying of detailed member information through a unified interface.

---

<h2 id="structs-and-classes" style="color:#FF6347;">üèóÔ∏è Structs and Classes</h2>

The core data structures in the project include:

- **ContactInfo (Struct)**: Stores the contact information of a member, including phone and email.
- **NeonAcademyMemberStruct (Struct)**: A struct-based implementation of a member that conforms to `MemberInfoDisplayable`, storing details such as `name`, `title`, `horoscope`, `memberLevel`, `homeTown`, `age`, and `contactInfo`.
- **ContactInformation (Class)**: Stores the contact information (phone number and email) in a reference-type class.
- **NeonAcademyMember (Class)**: A class-based implementation of a member that conforms to `MemberInfoDisplayable`, storing the same details as `NeonAcademyMemberStruct` but as a reference type.

Each member attribute includes:
- **Name**
- **Title**
- **Horoscope**
- **Membership Level**
- **Home Town**
- **Age**
- **Contact Information**

<h2 id="functions" style="color:#4682B4;">‚öôÔ∏è Functions</h2>

This project includes several functions for managing and displaying member data:

1. **displayInfo()** - Defined in `MemberInfoDisplayable` protocol and implemented in both `NeonAcademyMemberStruct` and `NeonAcademyMember`, it prints detailed information about each member.
2. **displayAllMembersInfo(members: [MemberInfoDisplayable])** - A function that iterates through all members in the given list and calls `displayInfo()` for each one, providing a full display of all members' information.

These functions ensure that the project remains easy to use and allows for quick data retrieval and display.

Here‚Äôs an example usage of the Neon Academy Member Directory project:

```swift
// Define members
let newMemberContact = ContactInfo(phone: "1233445", email: "example@gmail.com")
let newMember = NeonAcademyMemberStruct(name: "Jane Doe", title: "Developer", horoscope: "Gemini", memberLevel: "A1", homeTown: "NYC", age: 29, contactInfo: newMemberContact)

let memberContact = ContactInformation(phoneNumber: "0537 565 1304", email: "john.doe@gmail.com")
let member = NeonAcademyMember(fullName: "John Doe", title: "iOS Developer", horoscope: "Scorpio", memberLevel: "A2", homeTown: "San Francisco", age: 32, contactInformation: memberContact)

// Add members to a list and display information
var allMembers: [MemberInfoDisplayable] = [newMember, member]
displayAllMembersInfo(members: allMembers)
